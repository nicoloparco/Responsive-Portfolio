            <p>My name is Nico Loparco and I am currently participating in the Georgia Tech full-stack coding bootcamp.
               I recently graduated from the University of Georgia with a bachelor's degree of business administration focused on Finance as well as a minor's in Spanish.
               Originally from Chicago, I have since lived in Miami and Georgia and I currently reside in Alpharetta.
               I'm an avid sports fan and my two favorite teams are the Miami Heat and the Chicago Bears. I also love music and travelling.
